Homeowner request: Hang chandelier in the center of the dome which is also the
center of a sky light, also connected to a switch operated winch. Suffice it to
say I designed a way to accomplish just that with ornamental iron with the winch
mounted in the attic. Had everything reviewed by an engineer Functioned
flawlessly, mission accomplished.

Also designed the millwork package with some responsibility with the
installation.
