# About Me

Life long pursuit of building and designing in the residential building industry
with experience architecturally with the hospitality industry. Very hands on,
apprentice based education with multiple construction disciplines from framing
to finish carpentry and cabinet making skills from a very early age.

Possess analytical skills in the discovery and development of more efficient
methods and procedures regarding construction and finish carpentry labor efforts
to improve productivity and reduce labor costs and improve material usage and
management.

Creative designer with visionary problem solving skills fostered by my trade
based, hands on work experience in multiple trade disciplines.

Possess a knowledge of the language of shapes and profiles in their correct
application in the design process to remain true to historical architectural and
ornamental embellishment styles. An architectural style should be identified as
a reference point early in the design process. Begin with the end in mind.

Time in the outdoors enables / allows me to reconnect and sharpen the saw.
